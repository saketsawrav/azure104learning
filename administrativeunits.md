1. Understanding the concept of administrative units in Azure:
	* Administrative units are groups of users and resources that can be managed together in Azure AD.
	* They provide a way to segregate management tasks based on department or group membership.
	* Administrative units can be created using the Azure portal, PowerShell cmdlets, or Microsoft Graph.
2. Creating administrative units:
	* To create an administrative unit, navigate to the "Azure Active Directory" section in the Azure portal.
	* Click on "Administrative Units" under the "Manage" section.
	* Enter a name for our administrative unit and select the users or groups we want to assign to it.
	* Choose the level of access and permissions we want to grant to members of the administrative unit.
3. Assigning users to administrative units:
	* Users can be assigned to an administrative unit using the Azure portal, PowerShell cmdlets, or Microsoft Graph.
	* When assigning users, consider their role in the organization and the tasks they will be responsible for performing.
	* we can also assign multiple roles to a single user to give them more permissions.
4. Managing administrative units:
	* Once created, administrative units can be managed using the Azure portal, PowerShell cmdlets, or Microsoft Graph.
	* Management tasks include adding/removing users, assigning roles and permissions, and monitoring usage.
	* we can also use Azure Security Center to monitor and audit administrative unit activities for security and compliance.
5. Considerations when working with administrative units:
	* Management tools: Choose the tool that best fits our needs and preferences.
	* Role requirements: Plan our strategy according to role privileges in the Azure portal.
	* Scope of administrative units: Remember that the scope of an administrative unit applies only to management permissions.
	* User experience: Assign users to administrative units based on their experience level with Azure AD and the tasks they will be responsible for performing.
6. Integration with other systems: Depending on our organization's needs, we may want to integrate administrative units with other systems, such as Active Directory or Azure SQL Database.
7. Flexibility: Allow for flexibility in the administrative unit structure so we can easily make changes as needed.
